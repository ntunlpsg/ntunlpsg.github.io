      <description>This is a tool to translate an English sentence into Malay and vice versa. Developing a translation tool for low-resource languages like Malay has always been a challenge. The main challenge comes from the fact that machine translation systems typically rely on a huge amount of sentence-parallel data, and creating such datasets is an expensive process. In our work, we collected parallel datasets from various sources including News, OpenSubtitiles (OPUS), Ted talks, and Youtube video.</description>
