      <description>Online Demo Figure 1 shows the model architecture of SegBot. For EDU segmentation, the units in the input $ U0 \ to \ U8 $ are words in a sentence. Formally, given an input sequence $ U = (U_1, U_2, &amp;hellip; , U_N) $ of length $N$, we get its distributed representations $ X = (x_1, x_2, &amp;hellip; , x_N $ by looking up the corresponding embedding matrix, where $x_n \in R^k$ is the representation for the unit $U_n$ with $K$ being the dimensions.</description>
