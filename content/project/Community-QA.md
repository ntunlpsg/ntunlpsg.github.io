### About

This Resource includes:

- A live demonstration of question-answering system.
- Relevant publications for question-answering system.

### Demo

[link to live Qatar Living system] (http://www.qatarliving.com/betasearch)


This search tool helps you to find good answers to your question by searching through previously asked questions in the Qatarliving forum. The underlying technology is developed at [QCRI](http://qcri.org.qa/) and [MIT](http://web.mit.edu/) in collaboration with Qatar Living.
