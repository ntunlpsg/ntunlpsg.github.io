abstract = "In this work, we present a method for classifying the quality of blog comments using Linear-Chain Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). This approach is found to yield high accuracy on binary classification of high-quality comments, with conversational features contributing strongly to the accuracy. We also present a new corpus of blog data in conversational form, complete with user-generated quality moderation labels from the science and technology news blog Slashdot."
