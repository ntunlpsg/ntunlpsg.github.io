abstract = "Training on only perfect Standard English cor- pora predisposes pre-trained neural networks to discriminate against minorities from non- standard linguistic backgrounds. We perturb the inflectional morphology of words to craft plausible and semantically similar adversarial examples that expose these biases in popu- lar models, e.g., BERT and Transformer, and show that adversarially finetuning them for a single epoch significantly improves robustness without sacrificing performance on clean data."
