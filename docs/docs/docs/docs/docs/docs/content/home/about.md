# Welcome!
We are the Natural Language Processing (NLP) Research Group at the Nanyang Technological University (NTU). Our work covers all aspects of NLP research, ranging from core NLP tasks to key downstream applications, and new machine learning methods. We collaborate with other research groups at NTU including computer vision, data mining, information retrieval, linguistics, and medical school, and also with external partners from academia and industry.
