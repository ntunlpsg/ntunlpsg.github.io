Query–relevant summarization tries to remove the onus on the end–user by providing more condensed and direct access to relevant information. Query–relevant summarization is the task to synthesize a fluent, well–organized summary of the document collection that answers the user questions. We extracted several features of different types (i.e. lexical, lexical semantic, statistical and cosine similarity ) for each of the sentences in the document collection in order to measure its relevancy to the user query.

measure, semantic similarity measure,

characteristics which differ from written monologues (e.g., text books, news articles)

like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and its variations, which are successful in
finding topics in monologue or dialog, may not be successful by themselves in
asynchronous written conversations like emails. However, an effective combination
of LDA with other important features can give us the desired results. We first
point out the specific characteristics of emails that we need to consider in order to
find the inherent topics discussed in an email conversation. Then we demonstrate
why the generative topic models by themselves may not be adequate for this task.
We propose a novel graph-theoretic framework to solve the problem. Crucial to
our proposed approach is that it captures the discriminative email features and integrates
the strengths of the supervised approach with the unsupervised technique
considering LDA yet as one of the important factors.},

  Abstract = {We propose a novel approach for developing
a two-stage document-level discourse
parser. Our parser builds a discourse tree
by applying an optimal parsing algorithm
to probabilities inferred from two Conditional
Random Fields: one for intrasentential
parsing and the other for multisentential
parsing. We present two approaches
to combine these two stages of
discourse parsing effectively. A set of
empirical evaluations over two different
datasets demonstrates that our discourse
parser significantly outperforms the stateof-the-art,
often by a wide margin.},

Most importantly, instead of deciding upfront which types of features are important, we use the learning framework of preference re-ranking kernels to learn the features automatically.

structure. In this article, we present CODRA— a COmplete probabilistic Discriminative
framework for performing Rhetorical Analysis in accordance with Rhetorical Structure Theory,
which posits a tree representation of a discourse.
CODRA comprises a discourse segmenter and a discourse parser. First, the discourse
segmenter, which is based on a binary classifier, identifies the elementary discourse units in a
given text. Then the discourse parser builds a discourse tree by applying an optimal parsing
algorithm to probabilities inferred from two Conditional Random Fields: one for intra-sentential
parsing and the other for multi-sentential parsing. We present two approaches to combine these
two stages of parsing effectively. By conducting a series of empirical evaluations over two
different data sets, we demonstrate that CODRA significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art,
often by a wide margin. We also show that a reranking of the k-best parse hypotheses generated
by CODRA can potentially improve the accuracy even further.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:
The importance of sleep is paramount to health. Insufficient sleep can reduce physical, emotional, and mental well-being and can lead to a multitude of health complications among people with chronic conditions. Physical activity and sleep are highly interrelated health behaviors. Our physical activity during the day (ie, awake time) influences our quality of sleep, and vice versa. The current popularity of wearables for tracking physical activity and sleep, including actigraphy devices, can foster the development of new advanced data analytics. This can help to develop new electronic health (eHealth) applications and provide more insights into sleep science.
OBJECTIVE:
The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of predicting sleep quality (ie, poor or adequate sleep efficiency) given the physical activity wearable data during awake time. In this study, we focused on predicting good or poor sleep efficiency as an indicator of sleep quality.
METHODS:
Actigraphy sensors are wearable medical devices used to study sleep and physical activity patterns. The dataset used in our experiments contained the complete actigraphy data from a subset of 92 adolescents over 1 full week. Physical activity data during awake time was used to create predictive models for sleep quality, in particular, poor or good sleep efficiency. The physical activity data from sleep time was used for the evaluation. We compared the predictive performance of traditional logistic regression with more advanced deep learning methods: multilayer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), simple Elman-type recurrent neural network (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM-RNN), and a time-batched version of LSTM-RNN (TB-LSTM).
RESULTS:
Deep learning models were able to predict the quality of sleep (ie, poor or good sleep efficiency) based on wearable data from awake periods. More specifically, the deep learning methods performed better than traditional logistic regression. “CNN had the highest specificity and sensitivity, and an overall area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.9449, which was 46% better as compared with traditional logistic regression (0.6463).
CONCLUSIONS:
Deep learning methods can predict the quality of sleep based on actigraphy data from awake periods. These predictive models can be an important tool for sleep research and to improve eHealth solutions for sleep.}

two novel joint learning models that are
on-line and integrate inference within learning.
The first one jointly learns two node- and
edge-level MaxEnt classifiers with stochastic
gradient descent and integrates the inference
step with loopy belief propagation. The second
model is an instance of fully connected
pairwise CRFs (FCCRF). The FCCRF model
significantly outperforms all other approaches

Crucial elements for its success are the global

In this paper, we propose to use Deep Neural Network (DNN) to address two types of information needs of response organizations: 1) identifying informative tweets and 2) classifying them into topical classes. DNNs use distributed representation of words and learn the representation as well as higher level features automatically for the classification task. We propose a new online algorithm based on stochastic gradient descent to train DNNs in an online fashion during disaster situations.

We first design discourse-aware similarity measures, which use all- subtree kernels to compare discourse parse trees in accordance with the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST). Then, we show that a simple linear combination with these measures can help improve various existing machine translation evaluation metrics regarding correlation with human judgments both at the segment- and at the system-level. This suggests that discourse information is complementary to the information used by many of the existing evaluation metrics, and thus it could be taken into account when developing richer evaluation metrics, such as the WMT-14 winning combined metric DISCOTKparty. We also provide a detailed analysis of the relevance of various discourse elements and relations from the RST parse trees for machine translation evaluation. In particular, we show that (i) all aspects of the RST tree are relevant, (ii) nuclearity is more useful than relation type, and (iii) the similarity of the translation RST tree to the reference RST tree is positively correlated with translation quality.}

In the second approach, we present a set of Neural Fusion Models (NFM) that combines the in- and the out-domain models by readjusting their parameters based on the in-domain data.
We evaluated our models on the standard task of translating English-to-German and Arabic-to-English TED talks. The NDAM models achieved better perplexities and modest BLEU improvements compared to the baseline NNJM, trained either on in-domain or on a concatenation of in- and out-domain data. On the other hand, the NFM models obtained significant improvements of up to +0.9 and +0.7 BLEU points, respectively.

We observe that both approaches degrade the performance of the system when working on the translated text, especially the kernel-based system, which depends heavily on a syntactic kernel. We address this issue using a cross-language tree kernel, which compares the original Arabic tree to the English trees of the related questions. We show that this kernel almost closes the performance gap with respect to the monolingual system. On the neural network side, we use the parallel corpus to train cross-language embeddings, which we then use to represent the Arabic input and the English related questions in the same space. The results also improve to close to those of the monolingual neural network. Overall, the kernel system shows a better performance compared to the neural network in all cases.}

However, many such online forums are not moderated, resulting in many low quality and redundant comments, which makes it very challenging for users to find the appropriate answers to their questions. In this paper, we apply a user-centered design approach to develop a system, CQAVis, which supports users in identifying high quality comments and get their questions answered. Informed by the user's requirements, the system combines both text analytics and interactive visualization techniques together in a synergistic way. Given a new question posed by the user, the text analytic module automatically finds relevant answers by exploring existing related questions and the comments within their threads. Then the visualization module presents the search results to the user and supports the exploration of related comments. We have evaluated the system in the wild by deploying it within a CQA forum among thousands of real users. Through the online study, we gained deeper insights about the potential utility of the system, as well as learned generalizable lessons for designing visual text analytics systems for the domain of CQA forums.}

  abstract={Participants in an asynchronous conversation (e.g., forums, emails) interact with each other
at different times, performing certain communicative acts, called speech acts (e.g., question,
request). In this article, we propose a hybrid approach to speech act recognition in asynchronous
conversations. Our approach works in two steps: a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent
neural network first encodes each sentence separately into a distribution representation, which
are then used in a conditional structured model to capture the conversational dependencies
between sentences. The structured model can consider arbitrary graph structures to model conversational
dependencies in an asynchronous conversation. In addition, to mitigate the problem
of limited annotated data in the asynchronous domains, we adapt the recurrent model to learn
from synchronous conversations (e.g., meetings) using adversarial training of neural networks.
Empirical evaluation shows the effectiveness of our approach over existing ones: (i) LSTMs
provide better task-specific representations, (ii) the global structured model improves over local
models, and (iii) adversarial training gives better domain-invariant representations.
